# ExtensionHost

This is a implementation of the DashClock Host and Extensions api found at https://github.com/romannurik/dashclock

Extension Developers can use the included Sample Extension and API library to create or update their own Extensions that will work in both Chronus and the original DashClock app (no longer available).
